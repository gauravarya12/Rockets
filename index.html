                <p>A rocket is a missile, spacecraft, aircraft or other vehicle that obtains thrust from a 
                    rocket engine. Rocket engine exhaust is formed entirely from propellant carried within 
                    the rocket before use. Rocket engines work by action and reaction and push rockets forward 
                    simply by expelling their exhaust in the opposite direction at high speed, and can therefore
                     work in the vacuum of space.</p>

                <div class="gapbar"></div>
                <p>The first gunpowder-powered rockets evolved in medieval China under the Song dynasty by the 
                    13th century. The Mongols adopted Chinese rocket technology and the invention spread via 
                    the Mongol invasions to the Middle East and to Europe in the mid-13th century. Rockets are 
                    recorded in use by the Song navy in a military exercise dated to 1245. Internal-combustion 
                    rocket propulsion is mentioned in a reference to 1264, recording that the "ground-rat", 
                    a type of firework, had frightened the Empress-Mother Gongsheng at a feast held in her honor 
                    by her son the Emperor Lizong. Subsequently, rockets are included in the military treatise 
                    Huolongjing, also known as the Fire Drake Manual, written by the Chinese artillery officer 
                    Jiao Yu in the mid-14th century. This text mentions the first known multistage rocket, the 
                    'fire-dragon issuing from the water' (Huo long chu shui), thought to have been used by the 
                    Chinese navy.</p>
                <p>Medieval and early modern rockets were used militarily as incendiary weapons in sieges. 
                    Between 1270 and 1280, Hasan al-Rammah wrote al-furusiyyah wa al-manasib al-harbiyya 
                    (The Book of Military Horsemanship and Ingenious War Devices), which included 107 gunpowder 
                    recipes, 22 of them for rockets. In Europe, Konrad Kyeser described rockets in his 
                    military treatise Bellifortis around 1405.</p>
                <p>The Mysorean rockets were the first successful iron-cased rockets, developed in the late 
                    18th century in the Kingdom of Mysore (part of present-day India) under the rule of Hyder 
                    Ali. The Congreve rocket was a British weapon designed and developed by Sir William 
                    Congreve in 1804. This rocket was based directly on the Mysorean rockets, used compressed 
                    powder and was fielded in the Napoleonic Wars. It was Congreve rockets that Francis Scott 
                    Key was referring to when he wrote of the "rockets' red glare" while held captive on a 
                    British ship that was laying siege to Fort McHenry in 1814. Together, the Mysorean and 
                    British innovations increased the effective range of military rockets from 100 to 2,000 
                    yards.</p>
                <p>The first mathematical treatment of the dynamics of rocket propulsion is due to William 
                    Moore (1813). In 1815 Alexander Dmitrievich Zasyadko constructed rocket-launching platforms,
                     which allowed rockets to be fired in salvos (6 rockets at a time), and gun-laying devices. 
                     William Hale in 1844 greatly increased the accuracy of rocket artillery. Edward Mounier 
                     Boxer further improved the Congreve rocket in 1865.</p>
                <p>Modern rockets originated in 1926 when Goddard attached a supersonic (de Laval) nozzle to 
                    the combustion chamber of a liquid-propellant rocket. These nozzles turn the hot gas from 
                    the combustion chamber into a cooler, hypersonic, highly directed jet of gas, more than 
                    doubling the thrust and raising the engine efficiency from 2% to 64%. Use of liquid 
                    propellants instead of gunpowder greatly improved the effectiveness of rocket artillery in 
                    World War II, and opened up the possibility of human spaceflight after 1945.</p>
                <p>During the Cold War rockets became extremely important militarily with the development of 
                    modern intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). The 1960s saw rapid development of 
                    rocket technology, particularly in the Soviet Union (Vostok, Soyuz, Proton) and in the 
                    United States (e.g. the X-15). Rockets came into use for space exploration. American 
                    crewed programs (Project Mercury, Project Gemini and later the Apollo programme) culminated 
                    in 1969 with the first crewed landing on the Moon – using equipment launched by the Saturn V
                     rocket.</p>

                <div class="gapbar"></div>
                <p>Rocket vehicles are often constructed in the archetypal tall thin "rocket" shape that takes 
                    off vertically, but there are actually many different types of rockets including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tiny models such as balloon rockets, water rockets, skyrockets or small solid rockets that can be purchased at hobby store</li>
                    <li>Missiles</li>
                    <li>Space rockets such as the enormous Saturn V used for the Apollo program</li>
                    <li>Rocket cars</li>
                    <li>Rocket bike</li>
                    <li>Rocket-powered aircraft (including rocket assisted takeoff of conventional aircraft – RATO)</li>
                    <li>Rocket sleds</li>

                    <li>Rapid escape systems such as ejection seats and launch escape systems</li>
                    <li>Space Probes</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div id="design">
                <h1 class="zero_margin">Design</h1>
                <div class="gapbar"></div>
                <p>A rocket design can be as simple as a cardboard tube filled with black powder, but to make an efficient, 
                    accurate rocket or missile involves overcoming a number of difficult problems. The main difficulties 
                    include cooling the combustion chamber, pumping the fuel (in the case of a liquid fuel), and controlling 
                    and correcting the direction of motion.</p>
                <h2>Components</h2>
                <p>Rockets consist of a propellant, a place to put propellant (such as a propellant tank), and a nozzle. 
                    They may also have one or more rocket engines, directional stabilization device(s) (such as fins, vernier 
                    engines or engine gimbals for thrust vectoring, gyroscopes) and a structure (typically monocoque) to hold 
                    these components together. Rockets intended for high speed atmospheric use also have an aerodynamic fairing 
                    such as a nose cone, which usually holds the payload.</p>
                <p>As well as these components, rockets can have any number of other components, such as wings (rocketplanes), 
                    parachutes, wheels (rocket cars), even, in a sense, a person (rocket belt). Vehicles frequently possess 
                    navigation systems and guidance systems that typically use satellite navigation and inertial navigation 
                    systems.</p>
                <h2>Engines</h2>
                <div class="engine">
                    <img src="resources/rocket_engine.jpg" alt="Rocket Engine" />
                    <p>Rocket engines employ the principle of jet propulsion. The rocket engines powering 
                        rockets come in a great variety of different types; a comprehensive list can be found 
                        in rocket engine. Most current rockets are chemically powered rockets (usually internal 
                        combustion engines, but some employ a decomposing monopropellant) that emit a hot exhaust 
                        gas. A rocket engine can use gas propellants, solid propellant, liquid propellant, or 
                        a hybrid mixture of both solid and liquid. Some rockets use heat or pressure that is 
                        supplied from a source other than the chemical reaction of propellant(s), such as 
                        steam rockets, solar thermal rockets, nuclear thermal rocket engines or simple 
                        pressurized rockets such as water rocket or cold gas thrusters. With combustive 
                        propellants a chemical reaction is initiated between the fuel and the oxidizer in 
                        the combustion chamber, and the resultant hot gases accelerate out of a rocket engine 
                        nozzle (or nozzles) at the rearward-facing end of the rocket. The acceleration of 
                        these gases through the engine exerts force ("thrust") on the combustion chamber and 
                        nozzle, propelling the vehicle (according to Newton's Third Law). This actually happens 
                        because the force (pressure times area) on the combustion chamber wall is unbalanced by 
                        the nozzle opening; this is not the case in any other direction. The shape of the nozzle 
                        also generates force by directing the exhaust gas along the axis of the rocket.</p>
                </div>
                <h2>Propellant</h2>
                <div class="propellant">
                    <img src="resources/propellant.jpg" alt="propellant" />
                    <p>Rocket propellant is mass that is stored, usually in some form of propellant tank or 
                        casing, prior to being used as the propulsive mass that is ejected from a rocket engine 
                        in the form of a fluid jet to produce thrust. For chemical rockets often the propellants 
                        are a fuel such as liquid hydrogen or kerosene burned with an oxidizer such as liquid oxygen 
                        or nitric acid to produce large volumes of very hot gas. The oxidiser is either kept separate 
                        and mixed in the combustion chamber, or comes premixed, as with solid rockets. Sometimes 
                        the propellant is not burned but still undergoes a chemical reaction, and can be a 
                        'monopropellant' such as hydrazine, nitrous oxide or hydrogen peroxide that can be 
                        catalytically decomposed to hot gas. Alternatively, an inert propellant can be used 
                        that can be externally heated, such as in steam rocket, solar thermal rocket or 
                        nuclear thermal rockets. For smaller, low performance rockets such as attitude control 
                        thrusters where high performance is less necessary, a pressurised fluid is used as 
                        propellant that simply escapes the spacecraft through a propelling nozzle.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div id="uses">
                <h1 class="zero_margin">Uses</h1>
                <div class="gapbar"></div>
                <p>Rockets or other similar reaction devices carrying their own propellant must be used 
                    when there is no other substance (land, water, or air) or force (gravity, magnetism, light) 
                    that a vehicle may usefully employ for propulsion, such as in space. In these circumstances, 
                    it is necessary to carry all the propellant to be used.</p>
                <p>However, they are also useful in other situations:</p>
                <h2>Military</h2>
                <div class="military">
                    <img src="resources/missile.jpg" alt="Missile" />
                    <p>Some military weapons use rockets to propel warheads to their targets. A rocket and its 
                        payload together are generally referred to as a missile when the weapon has a guidance 
                        system (not all missiles use rocket engines, some use other engines such as jets) or as 
                        a rocket if it is unguided. Anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles use rocket engines to 
                        engage targets at high speed at a range of several miles, while intercontinental 
                        ballistic missiles can be used to deliver multiple nuclear warheads from thousands of 
                        miles, and anti-ballistic missiles try to stop them. Rockets have also been tested for 
                        reconnaissance, such as the Ping-Pong rocket, which was launched to surveil enemy 
                        targets, however, recon rockets have never come into wide use in the military.</p>
                </div>
                <h2>Science and Research</h2>
                <p>Sounding rockets are commonly used to carry instruments that take readings from 50 kilometers 
                    (31 mi) to 1,500 kilometers (930 mi) above the surface of the Earth. Rocket engines are also used 
                    to propel rocket sleds along a rail at extremely high speed. The world record for this is 
                    Mach 8.5.</p>
                <h2>Spaceflight</h2>
                <div class="spaceflight">
                    <img src="resources/spaceflight.jpg" alt="spaceflight" />
                    <p>Larger rockets are normally launched from a launch pad that provides stable support 
                        until a few seconds after ignition. Due to their high exhaust velocity—2,500 to 4,500 
                        m/s (9,000 to 16,200 km/h; 5,600 to 10,100 mph)—rockets are particularly useful when 
                        very high speeds are required, such as orbital speed at approximately 7,800 m/s 
                        (28,000 km/h; 17,000 mph). Spacecraft delivered into orbital trajectories become 
                        artificial satellites, which are used for many commercial purposes. Indeed, rockets 
                        remain the only way to launch spacecraft into orbit and beyond. They are also used 
                        to rapidly accelerate spacecraft when they change orbits or de-orbit for landing. 
                        Also, a rocket may be used to soften a hard parachute landing immediately before 
                        touchdown.</p>
